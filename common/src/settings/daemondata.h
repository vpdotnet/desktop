// aren't able to fetch the data at some point in the future, and so we (likely)
// have some data to work with at startup.
//

// an internalized format.  The caches may be reused even after a daemon update
// - internalized formats are likely to change in an update, but the format from
// the server is unlikely to change.  Internalized versions of the same data are
// provided in DaemonState.
//
// Some data here is not fetched but instead calculated by the daemon
// (latencies, winDnscacheOriginalPath, service quality data).  We usually
// preserve these on updates, but they can be discarded with little impact if
// the format changes.
