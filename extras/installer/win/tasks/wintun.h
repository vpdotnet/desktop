// These tasks handle uninstallation of the WinTUN driver package - both the
// legacy MSI package, and the current driver deployed by pia-wintun.dll.
// 
// In PIA 2.0-2.9, WinTUN was deployed as a shared component using an MSI.
// Installation of 2.10+ uninstalls this MSI if it is present, since it is no
// longer used.
// 
// PIA 2.10+ ships pia-wintun.dll, which includes the PIA-branded WinTUN driver
// as a resource and deploys it automatically.  We don't need to do anything
// during installation.  When uninstalling PIA, we call a WinTUN entry point
// to remove the driver package.

// Uninstall the legacy WinTUN MSI package.  Used when installing 2.10+.
